INSTALLATION
============

We now support only project configuration with CMake (www.cmake.org)

Linux:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create dir where you want the binaries to be build (we reffer to this dir as $BIN and to the path to directory
with source codes as $SRC). Source codes are in ./cpp/ directory. Change working directory to $BIN and run
CMake as follows:
 
	ccmake $SRC .
 
Now configure project with CMake. If MATLAB_ROOT directory is not found you can specify it by toggling the 
advanced options in CMake, however it is required only for producing the mex-files for interface of flandmark
detector with MATLAB.

After configuring with MATLAB compile the source codes with

	make
	
This will produce 2 executable examples:
	
	flandmark_1		- 	this example requires image as parameter. Then it performs OpenCV face detection and
					the facial landmark detection. Only the biggest face in image is detected. Optionaly
					user can specify also second argument - the name of output image, if this argument is 
					specified, image with detected landmarks is produced.
						
	flandmark_2		-	this example requires webcamera or video sequence. It starts capturing frames from camera and performs
					OpenCV face detection together with the flandmark detector. It is also possible to save the 
					generated output both for webcamera and video sequence input.

If CMake is configured with path to MATLAB it also produces 2 mex-files:

	flandmark_load_model	- 	mex-file that produces binary .dat file with flandmark model data structure
	flandmark_detector	- 	mex-file that performs facial landmark detection

Precompiled project for 64bit Linux (Ubuntu 9.10) is available in:

	./bin/linux64/
						
Windows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run cmake-gui, specify the source codes and binary directories. Configure project. In the binary directory
you can find generated project files. Compile the project with IDE chosen during CMake project configuration.
		

Precompiled project for 32bit Windows 7 is available in:

	./bin/win32/
		
		
		
MATLAB
======

To test produced mex-file just run one of the following MATLAB scripts:

	./test_flandmark.m		- 	This script randomly chooses one image and performs flandmark detection
	./test_flandmark2.m		- 	This script randomly chooses several images and performs flandmark detection
	
For learning the parameters of detector just run the following script:
	
	./learning/flandmark_learn.m	- 	This is the main script that calls several another scripts.
